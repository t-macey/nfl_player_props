    "#### Intro & motivation:\n",
    " - Build a sim model for player props that leverages air yards, target volume, and NflFastR's pre-modelled variables such as cp and yac \n",
    " - Adjust inputs based on own research and use simulation results to place bets where value identified\n",
    " - Notion that there may be biases within prop markets that don't consider these - e.g. lot's of noise with wide reciever yardage totals - target share and air yards are more predictive than yardage totals\n",
    " - Top down approach - takes market QB attempts prop line as given"

    "#### Some thoughts, takeaways and potential improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Needs manual adjustment - most notably with target share, as exp weighted doesn't take into account weeks where player may have left game\n",
    "early/players above them in depth chart injured/ etc. This part requires vetting and manual research and can be more of an art than science\n",
    "at times\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can be thought of more as, if x player has this predicted target share against x defense, and qb throws x times, then this is their expected\n",
    "yardage distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lack of backtesting: I can't find any publicly available historical player props to use for backtesting, but even if a dataset publicly\n",
    "existed, a backtest may not be the most accurate due to the aforementioned manual adjustments. The results from having traded the model\n",
    "against bet365 prices are positive, with a 3/4% ROI on ~300 bets over 2021/2022 seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can definitely be refactored using OOP principles - when I first built the model I had only coded functionally. Even so there is a lot of room for improvement functionally speaking - i.e. splitting out more functions, making certain lines more concise, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- YAC accuracy, model doesn't account for yard line and thus we can't accurately depicted the max yac on a play. This may have an effect if playing in games as big underdogs/favourites, where we may see expected yardline of pass play to differ to prior distribution."
